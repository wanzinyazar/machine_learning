Machine Learning Portfolio


In this portfolio, repositories contain machine learning projects completed by me for academic purpose , 
enthusiastic of self-learning and continuous interest. 
This portfolio is presented in Co-Lab notebooks(hosted by Google) and as well as in python version.

All academic works are done by me and from the sources that I learned from mlacademy.io /acknowledged 
to Venkatesh Tadinada.

Note: Data that used in this portfolio is for academic and demonstration purpose ONLY!!!

California Housing Price

Compared income category proportion in Stratified Sampling and Random Sampling. Visualized the data to gain insights with Matplotlib. Processed the categorical input feature to a one-hot vector and took care of missing values. Analyzed this end to end machine learning project with different models.
